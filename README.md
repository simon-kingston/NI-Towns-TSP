| ------------- |
| A map produced by NISRA in 2015 showing all towns in Northern Ireland, defined as areas with a population greater than 5,000 |

This app calculate the optimized route between the towns that make up Northern Ireland. stating position and ending position remains same. It gives you a optimized sequence of places to travel so that all places could be covered in minimum distance exactly once.
