## Towns in Northern Ireland
| ![](https://github.com/simon-kingston/NI-Towns-TSP/blob/master/northern_ireland_thumbnail.jpg) |
| ------------- |
| A map produced by NISRA in 2015 showing all towns in Northern Ireland, defined as areas with a population greater than 5,000 |

- A large town has a population of 18,000 plus, a medium town between 10,000 and 18,000 and a small town 5,000 to 10,000 inhabitants.

- Using 2011 Census information, Nisra separates places into seven different categories, with Belfast and Derry in the top two bands for population, at just more than 280,000 and 83,000 respectively.

- The remaining five are divided into towns (large, medium or small), intermediate settlements and villages.

## Travelling Salesman Problem

- The travelling salesman problem asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?"

- This app calculate the optimized route between the towns that make up Northern Ireland. stating position and ending position remains same. It gives you a optimized sequence of places to travel so that all places could be covered in minimum distance exactly once.
